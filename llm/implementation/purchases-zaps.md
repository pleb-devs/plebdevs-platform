# Purchases & Zap Implementation (2026-01-10)

## Data & Pricing Anchors
- Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma` `Purchase` includes `paymentType`, `priceAtPurchase`, optional `zapReceiptId` (unique), `invoice`, `zapReceiptJson`, `zapRequestJson`; uniqueness on `(userId, courseId, resourceId)` plus `(userId, courseId)` / `(userId, resourceId)` prevents duplicate entitlements per item.
- Price resolution: `src/lib/pricing.ts` `resolvePriceForContent` treats the DB price as authoritative. Nostr price hints are used **only for UI display** when no DB price exists; mismatches are logged via `onMismatch` but not surfaced in the UI. **Important**: The purchase/claim flow (`/api/purchases/claim`) enforces DB-only pricing and will **reject** claims when `priceSource === "nostr"` (lines 430-445), preventing attackers from bypassing payment by submitting `nostrPrice: 0`. Content without an authoritative DB price cannot be purchased. The dialog may briefly show stale Nostr hints until refresh (see purchase-gaps.md §3).
- Content gating: `src/app/api/resources/[id]/route.ts` and `src/app/api/courses/[id]/route.ts` gate paid content using snapshot-aware checks (`min(priceAtPurchase, currentPrice)`); resource access can also unlock via course lessons (`checkCourseUnlockViaLessons`). Resources cannot be deleted if purchases exist (`DELETE` guard).

## Zap Discovery
- **Client-driven**: `src/hooks/useInteractions.ts` subscribes to relays for kinds 9735/7/1 with filters on `eventId` or `a` tag; it caps stored receipts (200 total / viewer) rather than retaining full history. Receipt coverage now uses a relay union of `context relays + default + zapThreads + optional relayHints` and supports per-target refetch (`refetch` increments an internal refresh tick). `summarizeZapReceipt` parses amounts, normalizes payer pubkeys (`pubkey` and `P` tags), and stores `ZapReceiptSummary`. Viewer totals (`viewerZapTotalSats`, up to 200 `viewerZapReceipts`) power live auto-claim eligibility.
- **Server-side claim-time fetch**: When receipt IDs or relay hints are provided to `/api/purchases/claim`, `validateZapProof` fetches receipts by ID across relay sets (see §Server Claim Pipeline step 4). This supports claiming zaps sent from other clients or when the live feed missed receipts.
- **Invoice-scoped fallback**: If claim payloads have an invoice but no known receipt IDs yet, the claim route now scans recent zap receipts scoped by `#e`/`#p` across `default + content + zapThreads (+ hints)` and matches candidates by `bolt11` before verification.

## Zap Sending (client)
- `src/hooks/useZapSender.ts`: resolves lightning details (profile cache + LNURL/Lightning address), fetches LNURL metadata (cached per endpoint), enforces min/max sendable, builds zap request with relay hints and optional `a` tag, and supports three signing paths: server-stored privkey, NIP-07, or generated anonymous keys (used for privacy mode or when no other signer is available).
- Privacy mode: adds `P` tag with the real session pubkey when available; signer key may be anonymous. Invoice description hash is checked against the signed zap request before exposing the invoice.
- Attempts WebLN payment automatically; on failure exposes invoice+QR and `retryWeblnPayment`. State machine: `idle → resolving → signing → requesting-invoice → invoice-ready → paying → success|error`.

## Purchase Eligibility & Dialog
- Eligibility hook: `src/hooks/usePurchaseEligibility.ts` marks eligible when `viewerZapTotalSats ≥ price` and not already purchased. Auto-claims by POSTing `/api/purchases/claim` with receipt IDs (viewer receipts filtered to matching event/e-tag) and a price hint; cooldown/backoff on repeated failures. Missing relay hint arrays are normalized to a stable empty list so callback/effect identity does not thrash when optional relay hints are not provided.
- Test coverage: `src/hooks/tests/usePurchaseEligibility.test.tsx` now covers partial→retry→unlock transitions and verifies retry failures notify at most once while background retries continue.
- Claim payload: `{resourceId|courseId, amountPaid, paymentType (default zap), zapReceiptId(s), invoice?, zapTotalSats, nostrPrice, zapReceiptJson?, zapRequestJson?, relayHints?, allowPastZaps?}`; `amountPaid` defaults to `max(viewerZapTotalSats, price)`. The `allowPastZaps` flag extends the receipt age limit from 24 hours to 1 year for the "Unlock with past zaps" flow (or uses `MAX_RECEIPT_AGE_MS` env var if set, which overrides both defaults).
- UI: `src/components/purchase/purchase-dialog.tsx` requires auth, lets the user choose amount, toggle privacy, sends a zap via `useZapSender`, then invokes `claimPurchase`. When an invoice exists but receipts are still propagating, the dialog now runs a bounded background claim loop (up to ~90s with backoff) so manual/external wallet payments can unlock without refresh. Viewer totals indicating eligibility before receipts propagate now go through that loop instead of stopping at cached state: polling is snapshot-aware and continues for partial purchases until unlock criteria are met; it only emits unlock completion UI/toasts when the purchase is actually unlocked. During invoice polling retries, claim requests are sent in invoice-only mode (`zapReceiptIds: []`, `zapReceiptEvents: []`) so stale cached receipt hints cannot block invoice fallback verification; the hook now treats explicit receipt fields as authoritative and does not backfill `zapReceiptId` from cached receipts in that path. The relay hint list is now shared and stable when absent, preventing optional-path duplicate auto-claim invocations from unstable defaults. The invoice loop now re-checks cleanup after each awaited claim attempt so unmounted dialogs do not emit stale unlock callbacks/toasts after close. Auto-claim runs whenever the hook is mounted for locked content; partial auto-claim successes keep retrying (cooldown/backoff) instead of stopping permanently, and the success callback is reserved for unlock-level completion. The retry loop is timer-driven off cooldown expiry (not dependency-change-driven), so retries continue even if no other state changes occur between partial claims. Auto-claim error callbacks are now emitted only on the first retry failure per content/session lifecycle to avoid repeated destructive toast spam during transient receipt propagation. Purchase state is reset on identity/content context changes so stale unlock state does not suppress new auto-claim attempts. Partial payments are recorded; unlock callbacks only flip UI when `amountPaid` meets the required snapshot price.
- UI also exposes an “Unlock with past zaps” CTA when eligible, calling `claimPurchase` without sending a new zap.

## Server Claim Pipeline (`POST /api/purchases/claim`)
1) Auth + payload validation (`zod`, `paymentTypeEnum zap|manual|comped|refund`); exactly one of `resourceId` or `courseId` required.  
2) Resolve canonical price + identifiers via `resolvePriceForContent`; reject if content missing or lacks both `noteId` and owner pubkey for zap claims.  
3) Build allowed payer list from session pubkey only. If none → reject with guidance to link a pubkey.  
4) Zap validation per receipt (`validateZapProof`): accepts inline receipt events or fetches by ID with relay hints; fans out across `default`, `content`, and `zapThreads` relay sets and retries (6×, 800 ms) for late receipts; verifies receipt/request signatures, receipt age (24h default, 1 year with `allowPastZaps`, configurable via `MAX_RECEIPT_AGE_MS` env), invoice vs receipt, description hash vs zap request, amount > 0, recipient matches owner pubkey, event match via `e` or `a` tags, payer (pubkey or `P` tag) matches allowed list, LNURL supports NIP-57 and provider pubkey matches the receipt.  
4b) If no receipt IDs are provided yet but an invoice is present, claim route scans recent invoice-related receipt candidates (scoped by event/recipient) and verifies matches by `bolt11` + full zap validation.  
5) Aggregate verified receipts (multi-receipt allowed); set `verifiedAmountSats` sum, keep representative invoice and zap request.  
6) Non-zap payment types require admin (`isAdmin`); trust provided amount/invoice.  
7) Duplicate defense: check `zapReceiptId` column and JSONB containment query to prevent reuse across purchases/users.  
8) Upsert logic: if purchase exists for user+item, merge new receipts (`mergeReceipts`), add only amounts tied to unseen receipt IDs, update `amountPaid`, `paymentType`, `zapReceiptId` (first), `invoice`, `priceAtPurchase` (if missing), and store zap proofs. If no new receipts, return existing purchase unchanged.  
9) Create path: write new `Purchase` with verified amounts, `priceAtPurchase`, and stored proofs.  
10) Errors: Prisma FK/unique errors mapped to 404/409; all others surface 500 with message.

## Access & Downstream Effects
- `/api/lessons/[id]` returns limited resource metadata when the viewer lacks access; course and resource routes include `requiresPurchase` flags.
- Profile publisher stats aggregate purchases and revenue (`src/app/api/profile/content/route.ts`).
- Account merges move purchases to the primary account (`src/lib/account-linking.ts`).
- UI purchase banners/components read `purchases` arrays and treat access as `amountPaid ≥ min(priceAtPurchase, currentPrice)` (cards, course pages, content viewers).

## Edge Cases Already Covered
- Single-receipt reuse across users is blocked (unique column + JSONB containment); multi-receipt aggregation still has a race window—see the uncovered item below.
- Multi-receipt aggregation avoids double-counting already stored receipts in the happy path.
- Anonymous/“private” zaps remain claimable because the `P` tag carries the real pubkey.
- Invoice description hash mismatch halts the flow (guards non-NIP-57 providers).
- Admin-only pathways for `manual/comped/refund` payment types.
- Price mismatch logging when nostr hint differs from DB price (helps audit under/overcharge risks).

## Uncovered / Outstanding Edge Cases
- Late/remote receipts are retried briefly, but there is still no background worker to reconcile after the request returns.
- Users without a linked pubkey cannot claim; logged-out zaps remain unclaimable by design.
- Content missing both `noteId` and owner pubkey cannot be sold (API rejects).
- Race window: JSONB containment check is not atomic with insert; multi-receipt reuse could slip if two claims race on different IDs of the same array.
